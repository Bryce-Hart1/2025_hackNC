## What is UNC Boy?

**UNC Boy** is our project from HackNC 2025, UNC Chapel Hill's in-house hackathon. For our project, we decided to use **Raylib** to make a dungeon crawler game. The theme for this hackathon was retro, and what's more retro than the NES? Our project is loosely based off of the dungeons found in the original Legend of Zelda for the NES, but with a slight twist. The goal for this game is to see how long you can last and see how high of a score you can get.
